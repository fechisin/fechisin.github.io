title: "Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/lindblad-SPT
excerpt: 'In this work, we interrogate the analogy between (i) pure state SPTs as ground states of local Hamiltonians and (ii) mixed state SPTs as steady states of local Lindbladians. We construct a Lindbladian which hosts a simple mixed-state SPT within its steady-state subspace, then add symmetric local perturbations to see if the new steady states lie in the same mixed-state phase as the original. We find that for generic symmetric perturbations, the answer is no, due to the onset of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.'
