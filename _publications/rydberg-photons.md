title: "Quantum Non-Demolition Photon Counting in a 2d Rydberg Atom Array"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rydberg-photons
excerpt: 'Rydberg arrays exhibit remarkable many-body physics due to strong Rydberg-Rydberg interactions which are possible between their constituent atoms. We present a protocol which leverages this physics to non-destructively count photons by temporarily storing them in the array.'
