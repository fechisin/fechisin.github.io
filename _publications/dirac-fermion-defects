title: "Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dirac-fermion-defects
excerpt: 'We study the effects of lattice rotational and translational symmetries on Dirac cones in lattice models and the Dirac fermion field theories to which they flow in the continuum. In particular, we find that models defined on lattices with defects flow to field theories with additional magnetic flux, the amount of which is determined by universal topological data. We use defect conformal field theory to identify observables sensitive to this additional flux and then measure it in critical lattice models.'
