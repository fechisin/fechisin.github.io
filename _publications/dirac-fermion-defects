title: "Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dirac-fermion-defects
excerpt: 'We study the influence of lattice rotational and translational symmetries on Dirac cones in lattice models and the Dirac fermion field theories to which they flow in the continuum. In particular, we find that models defined on lattices with defects flow to field theories with additional magnetic flux. We show how this is predicted by defect conformal field theory and measurable in critical lattice models.'
