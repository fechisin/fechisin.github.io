I'm a second-year physics PhD student at the University of Maryland working at the intersection of condensed matter theory and quantum information science. I'm especially interested in the mathematical machinery underlying quantum phases of matter as well as the observation of exotic quantum phases. I'm currently working with [Alexey Gorshkov](https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/gorshkov/) and [Victor Albert](https://sites.google.com/site/victorvalbert/home).

How did I get here?
======
I grew up in a small town outside of Roanoke, Virginia in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. My journey in physics began with some awesome teachers at the [Roanoke Valley Governor's School](https://www.rvgs.k12.va.us/), a half-day STEM magnet high school I commuted to each morning for half of my classes. My first taste of condensed matter physics came as a sophomore at Harvard College, when I began working with [Eric Heller](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/heller) on semiclassical descriptions of scattering from thermal crystals. A great experience in [Eugene Demler](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MjE0OTUw.TGlzdC84NDUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html)'s introductory course sold me on condensed matter theory, and I joined his group. For the remainder of my undergraduate career I studied magnon scattering in thin films for application in the magnon spectrosopy platform being developed in [Amir Yacoby](http://yacoby.physics.harvard.edu/)'s group.
