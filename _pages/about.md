I'm a physics PhD student at the University of Maryland studying condensed matter theory and quantum information. I'm advised by Maissam Barkeshli and Alexey Gorshkov and I'm particularly interested in topological quantum matter. I especially enjoy thinking about symmetries, working with tensor networks, and applying tools from quantum field theory and mathematics. You can explore my work in the [**Publications**](https://fechisin.github.io/publications/) tab.

<!-- How did I get here?
======
I grew up in a small town outside of Roanoke, Virginia.<!--My journey in physics began with some awesome teachers at the [Roanoke Valley Governor's School](https://www.rvgs.k12.va.us/), a half-day STEM magnet high school I commuted to each morning for half of my classes.-->
<!-- As an undergrad at Harvard College, I worked with [Eric Heller](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/heller) on semiclassical descriptions of scattering from thermal crystals and [Eugene Demler](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MjE0OTUw.TGlzdC84NDUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html) on magnon scattering in thin films. 

During my senior year, I was the Co-President of the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students. We launched a series of undergrad-orientied conversations with physicists from academia and industry called <em>Chilloquium</em>, the recordings of which are still [available online](https://www.youtube.com/@harvardsps6651/playlists). -->
